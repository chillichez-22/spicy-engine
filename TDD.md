Technical Design Document.

# Main Page

## About

This is the technical design document for the project where the code will be documented, and why it was written the way it was.
I well detail clearly: how the code function, why the code has been written this way, when the code should be used, and how the code is used.

## Writing Code

### Naming Conventions

#### Files

All files will be lowercase with _ to separate new words.

main.cpp
new_file.hpp
text_for_something.txt
new_file_2.md

#### Classes & Structs

All classes are structs will be PascalCase where each new word is a capital letter with no word delimiter.

class Vector
struct MyNewStruct
class LevelDataChunk

#### Methods & Variables & Everything else

Everything else will be camelCase where the first word has no capital letter at the start, but every following word has a capital start, with no word delimiter.

int add();
float subtractAllVectors();
bool isCollidingWithSomething();

int myInt;
float widthOfLine;
Vector2 screenSpaceCoord;


## Writing Documentation

Doxygen will be used primarily for code ==documentation== of function, classes with "/\*\*" ending with "*/" and variables with "/**<"  "*/">.
Code ==comments== will use default c++ comments structure.


### Code comments
```

// Code comment general descriptions

// Multi line comments 
// for longer description

```

### Code Documentation
```

// Class, Struct, Function....  documentation

/**
* @brief For brief one line descriptions
* 
* @details For longer multi line 
* descriptions of the code
* 
* @param [Parameter] To describe the inputted parameter
* 
* @returns To describe the return case ( not needed if void )
* 
* @examples To give multi-Line code snippets giving brief examples of
* how to use the code including parameters and returns
*/ 


// Variable documentation is used with the same style of doxygen comments with an arrow afterwards

int var; /**< Single line descriptions */

int var; //!< Detailed description of the member
         //!< using more than one line

```
